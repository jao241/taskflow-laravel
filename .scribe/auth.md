# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer 3T2n59OdHgCrAZ59sDNt8I0sJAke8fW7Cf5qAqlQ94c9f893"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You need to add another user if you forgoten your token.
